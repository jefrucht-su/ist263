            My name is Julian Frucht, and I’m a <strong>senior at Syracuse University pursuing a Dual Bachelor of Science in Public Relations at the S.I. Newhouse School Of Public Communications and Applied Data Analytics at the School of Information Studies</strong>. I am passionate about executing high-quality work for professional clients and expanding my PR and data analysis skillsets through coursework, involvement in on-campus organizations, and internships.
        </p>

        <p>
            After earning my degree, I hope to hold a position that allows me to use the knowledge I gained from my studies, campus involvement, and professional experience to help clients or the company I work for make critical decisions and build and maintain impactful relationships with its publics.
        </p>

        <p>I enjoy watching sports, skiing, and traveling.</p>
