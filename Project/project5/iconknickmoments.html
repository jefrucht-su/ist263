        <h2>May 8, 1970: The Knicks win their first championship:</h2>
        <p>•	Behind Willis Reed battling injury and scoring the first two baskets of the game, and Walt “Clyde” Frazier’s 36 points and 19 assists, the Knicks defeated the Lakers, 113-99, in Game 7 of the NBA Finals at Madison Square Garden, marking the first championship in franchise history. Reed took home the Finals MVP award as the Knicks took down a team featuring three all-time greats in Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, and Elgin Baylor.</p>

        <h2>May 10, 1973: The Knicks win their second championship:</h2>
        <p>•	Almost three years to the day after their first championship, the Knicks defeated the Lakers in Los Angeles, 102-93, to win their second title, this time in dominant fashion, four games to one. Earl “The Pearl” Monroe (23 points) and Bill Bradley (20 points, seven rebounds, and five assists) led the way for New York, and Willis Reed was awarded his second Finals MVP. The special 1973 team featured six Hall of Fame players: Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Earl Monroe, Jerry Lucas, and Bill Bradley. The legendary Red Holzman was also inducted as a coach.</p>

        <h2>May 25, 1993: The Dunk:</h2>
        <p>•	In Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Chicago Bulls, guard John Starks dunked the ball over Michael Jordan, the best player in the NBA at the time and arguably the greatest ever. The Knicks won the game to take a 2-0 series lead, but the Bulls won the next four games on the way to their third straight NBA title. </p>

        <p>•	On a summer day in New York City, Patrick Ewing led the way with 24 points, 22 rebounds, and seven assists, as the Knicks defeated the rival Indiana Pacers 94-90 to earn a trip to the finals for the first time since their championship in 1973. Unfortunately, the team fell to the Houston Rockets in seven games.</p>

        <h2>May 16, 1999: Allan Houston sends the Heat Home:</h2>
        <p>•	In a winner-take-all game 5 of the first round, Allan Houston hit a game-winner with under a second left. It was a floater from the free throw line that took a bounce off the rim and backboard before falling through the net. The Final score was 77-76, and the Knicks became just the second 8th seed in NBA history to defeat the one seed in the first round of the playoffs.</p>

        <h2>June 5, 1999: Larry Johnson’s 4-Point Play:</h2>
        <p>•	At Madison Square Garden, the Knicks trailed game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals 91-88 with under six seconds remaining, before Johnson nailed a 3-pointer, was fouled, and made the free-throw to give New York a 92-91 win and a 2-1 series lead. The Knicks went on to win the series 4-2 and became the first 8th seed ever to reach the NBA Finals.</p>

        <h2>Allan Houston (Guard):</h2>
        <p>•	Known for his smooth jumper, Houston averaged 18.5 points in nine seasons with the Knicks from 1996 to 2005. He had two All-Star appearances and helped the Knicks make history in 1999 by becoming the first eighth seed ever to reach the NBA Finals. This is the team’s most recent finals appearance.</p>

        <h2>Carmelo Anthony (Forward):</h2>
        <p>•	One of the greatest scorers in NBA history, “Melo” played seven seasons for the Knicks in the 2010s, during which he averaged just under 25 points, along with seven rebounds. Anthony won the NBA scoring title in the 2012-2013 season and led the Knicks to a 54-28 record. On January 24, 2014, Melo scored a Knicks and Madison Square Garden record 62 points in a win against the Charlotte Bobcats. Despite Anthony’s lack of team success in New York, being from Brooklyn, he is widely considered a New York basketball icon.</p>

        <h2>Jalen Brunson (Guard):</h2>
        <p>•	Brunson is largely credited with leading the Knicks’ revival in the 2020s, and in three seasons with the team so far, he has averaged 26.4 points and 6.7 assists. He has been named an all-star twice, and in 2025, he led the team to its first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2000. With the two-time NCAA champion leading the way, Knicks fans have a lot to be excited about over the next few years!</p>
