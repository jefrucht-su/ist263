        <h2>May 8, 1970: The Knicks win their first championship:</h2>
        <p>•	Behind Willis Reed battling injury and scoring the first two baskets of the game, and Walt “Clyde” Frazier’s 36 points and 19 assists, the Knicks defeated the Lakers, 113-99, in Game 7 of the NBA Finals at Madison Square Garden, marking the first championship in franchise history. Reed took home the Finals MVP award as the Knicks took down a team featuring three all-time greats in Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, and Elgin Baylor.</p>

        <h2>May 10, 1973: The Knicks win their second championship:</h2>
        <p>•	Almost three years to the day after their first championship, the Knicks defeated the Lakers in Los Angeles, 102-93, to win their second title, this time in dominant fashion, four games to one. Earl “The Pearl” Monroe (23 points) and Bill Bradley (20 points, seven rebounds, and five assists) led the way for New York, and Willis Reed was awarded his second Finals MVP. The special 1973 team featured six Hall of Fame players: Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Earl Monroe, Jerry Lucas, and Bill Bradley. The legendary Red Holzman was also inducted as a coach.</p>

        <p>•	In Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Chicago Bulls, guard John Starks dunked the ball over Michael Jordan, the best player in the NBA at the time and arguably the greatest ever. The Knicks won the game to take a 2-0 series lead, but the Bulls won the next four games on the way to their third straight NBA title. </p>

        <h2>May 16, 1999: Allan Houston sends the Heat Home:</h2>
        <p>•	In a winner-take-all game 5 of the first round, Allan Houston hit a game-winner with under a second left. It was a floater from the free throw line that took a bounce off the rim and backboard before falling through the net. The Final score was 77-76, and the Knicks became just the second 8th seed in NBA history to defeat the one seed in the first round of the playoffs.</p>

        <p>•	At Madison Square Garden, the Knicks trailed game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals 91-88 with under six seconds remaining, before Johnson nailed a 3-pointer, was fouled, and made the free-throw to give New York a 92-91 win and a 2-1 series lead. The Knicks went on to win the series 4-2 and became the first 8th seed ever to reach the NBA Finals.</p>

Lin continued his all-time run with 38 points and seven assists, as he out-dueled Kobe (34 points) to lead the Knicks to their fourth straight win.</p>

        <h2>January 24, 2014: Melo Scores 62:</h2>
        <p>•	Carmelo Anthony’s 62 points against the Charlotte Bobcats is the Knicks’ record for points scored in a game, and he passed Bernard King’s former 60-point record from Christmas Day in 1984. It is also the highest-scoring game at Madison Square Garden, a record that Kobe Bryant previously set when he scored 61 against the Knicks in 2009. Melo shot 23/35 from the field, 10/10 from the free throw line, and nailed six three-pointers. He also scored an electrifying 37 points in the first half, including a half-court buzzer beater to end the second quarter.</p>

        <h2>May 16, 2025: The Knicks Advance to their first Eastern Conference Finals in 25 Years:</h2>
        <p>•	On a spring night in New York City, the Knicks dismantled the defending champion Boston Celtics 119-81 to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2000, in a game where four of their starters scored over 20 points. New York was the heavy underdog before the series started, but after stealing each of the first two games in Boston in thrilling fashion, the team did not look back on its way to a six-game series win.</p>
