        <p>The Knicks were one of the 11 original NBA franchises that played in the league’s inaugural season in 1946-1947. The team’s two championships came in 1970 and 1973, and they have five other NBA Finals appearances. The team currently plays at Madison Square Garden in Midtown Manhattan, and its rivals include the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, and Miami Heat.</p>

        <h3>WHY SHOULD I WATCH THE CURRENT KNICKS?</h3>
        <p>After reaching the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in a quarter century in 2025, the Knicks have championship aspirations heading into the 2025-2025 campaign.</p>
        <p>The team is led by superstar point guard and reigning NBA Clutch Player of the Year Jalen Brunson, and features a supporting cast highlighted by 5-time All-Star and 3-time All-NBA center Karl-Anthony Towns.</p>
        <p>Under new Head Coach Mike Brown, the team is expected to play with a fast-paced, team-oriented offensive scheme.</p>
        <p>With new additions such as Jordan Clarkson and Guerschon Yabusele, the team turned its thin bench lineup into a strength, and the Knicks are expected to have nine to 10 strong contributors in the rotation throughout the regular season and into the 2026 playoffs.</p>
