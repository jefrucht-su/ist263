        <p>Under new Head Coach Mike Brown, the team is expected to play with a fast-paced, team-oriented offensive scheme.</p>
        <p>With new additions such as Jordan Clarkson and Guerschon Yabusele, the team turned its thin bench lineup into a strength, and the Knicks are expected to have nine to 10 strong contributors in the rotation throughout the regular season and into the 2026 playoffs.</p>
