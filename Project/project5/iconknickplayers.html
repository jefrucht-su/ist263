        <h4>Willis Reed (Center):</h4>
        <p>•	Regarded as one of the greatest Knicks of all time, Reed spent his entire 10-year career with the team from 1964 to 1974. He averaged 18.7 points, 12.9 rebounds, and over a block for his career. He made seven all-star teams, but is best known for winning Finals MVP in each of the Knicks’ only two championship seasons in 1970 and 1973. “The Captain” is famous for playing through an injury in game 7 of the 1970 finals against the Los Angeles Lakers and providing a spark that led to the team’s first title.</p>
