        <h2>Willis Reed (Center):</h2>

He averaged 18.7 points, 12.9 rebounds, and over a block for his career. He made seven all-star teams, but is best known for winning Finals MVP in each of the Knicks’ only two championship seasons in 1970 and 1973. “The Captain” is famous for playing through an injury in game 7 of the 1970 finals against the Los Angeles Lakers and providing a spark that led to the team’s first title.</p>

        <p>•	King spent just four seasons with the Knicks in the 1980s, but is remembered for his iconic 1984-1985 campaign, in which he led the NBA in scoring with 32.9 points per game. On January 31 and February 1, 1984, he scored 50 points in back-to-back games against the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks.

        <h2>Patrick Ewing (Center):</h2>
        <p>•	The first pick in the 1985 NBA draft, Ewing is considered one of the greatest Knicks of all time and spent the first 15 years of his career with the team. He stuffed the stat sheet, averaging just under 23 points, over 10 rebounds, just under three blocks, and a steal, and he is the Knicks’ all-time leader in countless statistical categories. In 1994, he led the team to its first finals appearance in over 20 years.</p>

        <p>•	Known for his smooth jumper, Houston averaged 18.5 points in nine seasons with the Knicks from 1996 to 2005. He had two All-Star appearances and helped the Knicks make history in 1999 by becoming the first eighth seed ever to reach the NBA Finals. This is the team’s most recent finals appearance.</p>

        <h2>Carmelo Anthony (Forward):</h2>
        <p>•	One of the greatest scorers in NBA history, “Melo” played seven seasons for the Knicks in the 2010s, during which he averaged just under 25 points, along with seven rebounds. Anthony won the NBA scoring title in the 2012-2013 season and led the Knicks to a 54-28 record. On January 24, 2014, Melo scored a Knicks and Madison Square Garden record 62 points in a win against the Charlotte Bobcats. Despite Anthony’s lack of team success in New York, being from Brooklyn, he is widely considered a New York basketball icon.</p>

        <h2>Jalen Brunson (Guard):</h2>
        <p>•	Brunson is largely credited with leading the Knicks’ revival in the 2020s, and in three seasons with the team so far, he has averaged 26.4 points and 6.7 assists. He has been named an all-star twice, and in 2025, he led the team to its first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2000. With the two-time NCAA champion leading the way, Knicks fans have a lot to be excited about over the next few years!</p>
