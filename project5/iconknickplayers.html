        <h3>WHY SHOULD I WATCH THE CURRENT KNICKS?</h3>
        <p>After reaching the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in a quarter century in 2025, the Knicks have championship aspirations heading into the 2025-2025 campaign.</p>
        <p>The team is led by superstar point guard and reigning NBA Clutch Player of the Year Jalen Brunson, and features a supporting cast highlighted by 5-time All-Star and 3-time All-NBA center Karl-Anthony Towns.</p>
        <p>Under new Head Coach Mike Brown, the team is expected to play with a fast-paced, team-oriented offensive scheme.</p>
        <p>With new additions such as Jordan Clarkson and Guerschon Yabusele, the team turned its thin bench lineup into a strength, and the Knicks are expected to have nine to 10 strong contributors in the rotation throughout the regular season and into the 2026 playoffs.</p>
